### Long Bio (250 words)

Baitjet is a rapper from Union City, New Jersey, forging a distinctive path in hip-hop with a grunge-influenced sound that prioritizes authenticity over polish. His music—released under DripJet Records—carries the raw energy of underground rap, with tracks like "Come to The Party" and "Talking to Nina" showcasing a style that's been described as "grungy but a good expression."

What sets Baitjet apart is his innovative release strategy: podcast-first distribution. By uploading music to podcast platforms before streaming services, he creates an exclusive experience for dedicated listeners. His tagline says it all: "if your here your a real one." This approach builds a community of genuine fans who get early access to every drop.

Recording at Sherny 911's studio, Baitjet maintains a DIY ethos that reflects the independence of his DripJet Records imprint. His music explores themes of perseverance, authenticity, and pushing through criticism—themes that resonate in his podcast description about "sticking to your guns" despite the "world of naysayers."

As a Union City artist, Baitjet carries the torch of New Jersey's rich hip-hop lineage—from Queen Latifah and Naughty By Nature to The Fugees and Redman. But where NJ legends often leaned toward polish or commercial appeal, Baitjet embraces imperfection as a feature, not a bug.

His target audience spans underground hip-hop fans who value authenticity over algorithms, New Jersey locals looking for hometown heroes, and podcast listeners who discover music through non-traditional channels.
