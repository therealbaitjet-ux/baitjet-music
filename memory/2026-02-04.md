## Key Discovery: Baitjet's True Identity

**Research revealed the user's actual identity:**
- **Name:** Baitjet
- **Location:** Union City, New Jersey
- **Instagram:** @mr.j.c.santos
- **Genre:** Rap/Hip-Hop (grunge-influenced style)
- **Label:** DripJet Records
- **Studio:** Sherny 911's studio (personal friend)
- **Unique Strategy:** Podcast-first music releases

**Previously incorrect assumption:** Had built website positioning as "Future Bass & Trap Music Producer" - COMPLETELY WRONG.

**Correction made:** Updated entire website (`~/baitjet-music/`) to rap/hip-hop identity with:
- Union City, NJ positioning
- NJ hip-hop lineage references (Queen Latifah, Naughty By Nature, The Fugees, Redman, Joe Budden)
- Podcast-first release strategy emphasis
- Connected Instagram @mr.j.c.santos
- "Come to The Party" (2021) as debut single
- DripJet Records branding
- Grunge rap aesthetic
